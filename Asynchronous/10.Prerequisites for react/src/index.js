import { add as addition, factorial, multiply } from "./math.js";
// here we are using an alias by using as keyword
// addition is alias for add since add function already exists in index.js file
// this will resolve ambiguity - which add function to call exported one or the one
// present in index.js

// named exports can be renamed using alias

// default export can be named anything
import x, * as math from "./math.js"; // all named exported members will become available on
// math object

// here x is default export from math.js i.e subtraction
